# Virtual Pet Shelter

This console application allows a user to care for virtual pets that are in a Virtual Pet Shelter.

Users can feed and water all the pets, or individually play with a pet.

They can take new animals into the shelter and allow for animals to be adopted as well. 

The main feature of the Virtual Pet Shelter is the use of a HashMap to store each VirtualPet object. 

## Biggest Challenges
The unique ID for each key in the HashMap is generated by the VirtualPetShelter object and is not stored with each individual VirtualPet Object.  Therefore, to call an  individual VirtualPet, I found myself searching the HashMap for Entry values.

In retrospect, it may have been better to add a field to the VirtualPet object for account ID, and use that as the Key. I would have gone this route, however, the project spec required playing with an animal BY NAME, and so I would have had to look up Entry data regardless.
